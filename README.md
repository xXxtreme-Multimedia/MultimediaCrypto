Web server, forum, database, block explorer, coin info, crypto, vulnerability testing, penetration testing and more.

  All of the parts of a crypto network. There will be a base market coin that only trades on the exchange. There will be no public wallet for the coin and it cannot be publicly mined. Work in progress.
  
   The web server and forum will be built for crypto related discussions, news, market changes, give-aways and information about crypto and trading. Discussions should include basics for beginners, intermediate trading and mining.
   
   The mining pool will be set up to mine a private pool. The private, base market coin. Only by invite can anyone mine on the private pool. Merge mined coins may be included. Other coins may or may not be added.
     
  The exchange will have a selection of coins at the beginning. Coins are listed by request of a developer or team member. A vetting process will occur. Vetting includes checking for hooks, master wallets, hidden processes, irc seeding, and other poor practices.

  We will post all of our tests for security, penetration, vulnerabilities and malware. All of the screen captures should be time stamped. Each time a new set of scans is performed, the results should be posted. No server can be 100% unbreakable. But, the harder you make it, the lesser likely someone wants to bother. Transparancy and security should be a priority for any crypto network. Accountability should always be required.
